# Codec abbreviations: spec page

Status: written in X11 (branch `arena/95aaefc1-kompkernel`). Each entry states what the code does, whether the encoder is greedy, how it was measured, and its time/CPU bound. Entries marked **label-only** were not re-read or re-measured in X11. Their description comes from the `label` in `src/lib/omega/registry.ts`.

## Measurement contract (applies to every entry)

- Metric: `M` = o200k_base tokens of the **contract plus wire**, in one chat message, with no system prompt and no skills file.
- Every reported lane is byte-exact. Round trip is checked in TypeScript, and where a CPython reader exists it is also checked on the messages.
- Identity arm = plain DAEDALUS. Any codec that fails a gate returns identity, so its `M` is never worse than DAEDALUS, except where the reported `M` includes an extra arm.

## Selection: greedy or not, tournament or not

Two different selection shapes appear in this stack. They must not be confused.

1. **Fixed rule plus binary gate (non-tournament).** One deterministic encoder rule, then one whole-message test that picks between two arms: the marked wire or identity. Examples: AKOLOUTHIA, AKOLOUTHIA-2, DIRFOLD, DITTO, UUIDFOLD. The rule is applied left to right and marks every position it is allowed to mark. It is greedy in that sense. It does not search over which positions to mark.
2. **Per-input minimum over several codecs (tournament).** The encoder runs several full codecs on the same input and keeps the shortest. Examples: DAEDALUS's predicted-arm portfolio, AMPHORA, KANON, CADMUS, and the `frontier-min` script used in benches. This is a tournament. Its cost is the sum of every candidate's cost. It is not a non-tournament method.

**Answer to "is the frontier-min approach non-tournament?"** No. `frontier-min` is a per-input minimum over six separately encoded candidates. It is a tournament and is reported only as a bench-side upper bound. Ship a tournament only with a selector byte and the contracts of every candidate. This session did not ship one.

## Entries

### AKOLOUTHIA-2 (`src/lib/omega/akolouthia2.ts`, registry key `akolouthia2`)

- **Design.** Arithmetic-progression elision across lines. A digit run at column `k` of line `i` is replaced by a marker `⁺` when the same column in line `i-1` and line `i-2` gives the same step. The reader computes `v(i-1,k) + (v(i-1,k) − v(i-2,k))`. The contract is the same 23-token sentence as AKOLOUTHIA v1. The reader rule is unchanged from v1. Only the encoder's eligibility test changed: v1 required a third matching step, and AKOLOUTHIA-2 requires two terms only.
- **Greedy or not.** Greedy: every eligible position is marked, left to right. Then the whole-message gate G3 picks marked or identity.
- **Gates.** G1 exact expansion of the substituted text. G2 DAEDALUS round trip on the substituted text. G3 `M(marked) < M(identity)`. Refused on: marker character already present in the input; numbers longer than 15 digits.
- **Measured (X11).** 43/43 lanes exact. Progression arm on 8 lanes. Total over 43 lanes: 32,839 → 32,426 (−413, −1.26%). Gains: chart.svg −135, df-h −110, kubectl −60, psql −42, dump −25, vix −25, page.html −14, bibliography −2. Prose lanes: 0. Red team: 40 TypeScript cases, 0 failures. CPython reader (`bench/akolouthia_decode.py`) on 32 progression-arm messages: 0 mismatches.
- **Time/CPU.** Encoder roughly 2–3× plain DAEDALUS, because the gates re-encode and re-count tokens. Measured single runs in this sandbox: 12 KB listing 23.6 s (plain DAEDALUS 11.4 s); 12 KB numstat 37.5 s (plain 16.1 s); 3.4 KB SVG 1.8 s (plain 0.6 s). Decode about 0 ms. Dominant cost is BPE token counting, not the substitution. The substitution pass is linear in total digits. A worst-case bound for the whole encoder is not proven here. These are single runs, not repeated measurements.
- **Citation (prior art).** LeCo, arXiv 2306.15374 (2023): delta and linear-model encodings for integer columns; arithmetic runs are a special case. LogShrink (Li, Zhang, Chen, ASE 2023, DOI 10.1145/3597503.3608129; read from a search snippet, not the full text): log commonality/variability. Numeric token parsing for logs, arXiv 2408.05760 (2024). None of these is an LLM-decoded, message-level codec; the message-level, two-term, LLM-readable form is the only part claimed as new here, and only as a measurement.
- **Status.** Registered. Not the frontier-minimum codec on every lane (see `git-numstat`, below).

### AKOLOUTHIA v1 (`src/lib/omega/akolouthia.ts`, `akolouthia`)

- Same contract and reader as AKOLOUTHIA-2. Encoder requires three matching steps. Its numbers are in `bench/z55/`, and it is superseded by AKOLOUTHIA-2 on every measured lane.

### DAEDALUS (`daedalus`) and DAEDALUS-D (`daedalus-dual`)

- **Label:** predicted-arm portfolio (DAEDALUS). DAEDALUS-D: DAEDALUS wire with a glyph pool where every glyph is one token under both o200k_base and cl100k_base.
- **Greedy or not.** Glyph aliasing of repeated substrings. Selection among arms is a predicted-arm portfolio, so it is a tournament-type selector.
- **Measured.** Mixed, not uniform. DAEDALUS-D is 1–3 tokens below DAEDALUS on de-kb, kb-article, llm-answer, bibliography, dump.sql, and vix; it is 5 tokens above DAEDALUS on email-thread, 6 above on kubectl, and 16 above on find-listing. Numbers: `bench/z56/receipts/frontier-v2-lanes.jsonl`.
- **Time/CPU.** Label-level; not re-measured in X11 beyond the timings above, which are per-input encoding costs.

### DENDRON (`dendron`) and DENS-2 / DENDRON-S (`dendrons`)

- **Label:** brace-tree notation for path and URL lists. DENDRON-S is the same on any separator, choosing `.` or `/` by one-chat M.
- **Greedy or not.** Deterministic factoring by shared first segment, with a gate against identity. Not a tournament beyond the two separator choices.
- **Measured (X11).** `dendrons` is the leader on `find-listing` (1318 vs DAEDALUS 1326) and `git-numstat` (1904 vs 2036). Identity on the rest.
- **Note.** The `dendrons` key is DENDRON-S. The DENS2 edits mentioned in the session memory are uncommitted and not measured here. The committed `dendrons` key is the one measured.

### GRAMMA (`gramma`)

- **Label:** notation-dialect menu. The layout is regenerated from the reader's formatting priors, and every dialect is gated byte-exact.
- **Measured.** Identity on every lane in `frontier-v2-lanes.jsonl`. Not a source of gains on these lanes.

### PHALANX-A10 (`phalanx-a10`)

- **Label:** PHALANX-A7 with VERITAS-C: token-window and character-substring dictionary, nested equals-free header, one greedy pass; identity-guarded.
- **Naming caveat.** The z55 report describes "A10" as PARADEIGMA + DAEDALUS-D. The registry label describes `phalanx-a10` as PHALANX-A10. Those descriptions differ. This report uses the registry key `phalanx-a10` as "A10" and says so. The composition in the z55 report is not re-verified.
- **Greedy or not.** One greedy pass for dictionary selection.
- **Measured.** Worse than plain DAEDALUS on every lane in X11's 17-lane run (+10 to +239 tokens). Timed out on the 40 KB `package-lock-head.json` after more than 30 minutes, and was stopped.

### PARADEIGMA (`paradeigma`)

- **Label:** template entailment for JSON records. Not run on the X11 17-lane set. Not measured in X11. The frontier-min in X11 therefore omits PARADEIGMA; the comparator is a lower-bound-of-frontier only for lanes with no JSON records.

### GNOMON (`gnomon`), SYNARTESIS (`synartesis`), ENTHYMEME, EPAGOGE, ELLEIPSIS (label-only)

- Entailment and fixed-field codecs for REST and lockfile structures. Not re-read or re-measured in X11.

### DIRFOLD, DITTO, UUIDFOLD, TABMIN (label-only)

- Each is a one-line rule with an identity fallback, i.e. the binary-gate shape above. Not re-measured in X11.

### ONOMASIA (negative, `src/lib/omega/onomasia.ts`, unregistered)

- Keyed addressing for progressions. Dropped. Loses to AKOLOUTHIA on chart, df-h, kubectl, psql. Gives no prose gain. Contract 29 tokens (keyed two-term) or 39 tokens (keyed, current wording). Receipts: `bench/z56/receipts/onomasia-43.jsonl` (33 rows, exact) and `bench/z56/keyed2-probe.ts`. `onomasia-holdout-rest` run failed on a literal glob; its 10 rows are partial and the run is moot.

### KLADOS (negative, `src/lib/omega/kladios.ts`, unregistered, uncommitted)

- Net loss; not adopted. Its bench files are intentionally not committed.

### HORA (X13, `src/lib/omega/hora.ts`, registry key `hora`, exact)

- Timestamp deltas. A full `YYYY-MM-DD<sep>HH:MM:SS.mmm` that follows a same-date timestamp is written as `※N` (N = signed ms from the previous timestamp). Reader: DAEDALUS decode, then add N back. Contract 23 tokens.
- Measured, one-chat M, o200k, `OMEGA_DET=1`: openstack-loghub-26.log identity 1008, HORA 987 (−21, exact). Red team 46/46 transform round trips. CPython reader 3/3. Receipts: `bench/z58/receipts/`.
- Scope: logs with millisecond ISO timestamps. Identity elsewhere (the other real lanes in the probe, see REPORT §5).
- Prior art: differential timestamp coding (Gorilla, VLDB 2015; LogReducer, FAST 2021; DeLog, arXiv 2601.15084). Novelty is only the one-chat wire on top of DAEDALUS.

### Alias tier (negative, X13, `bench/z58/alias-test.ts`, not registered)

- The user's language-tier idea, tested end to end with DAEDALUS on the substituted text. Best lane de-kb −4 (491 against 495); other lanes +10 to +15. The shortcut fails: DAEDALUS already captures frequent words, and the alias table costs more than the saving.

### ANAPHORA-FOLD (negative, X12, `src/lib/omega/anaphora-fold.ts`, unregistered)

- Two-sided field anchoring against the best of the K previous lines (header `@k,n,m|X`). Byte-exact (TS round trip; CPython reader `bench/anaphora_fold_decode.py`, 15/15 forced folds). Fails G3 on every lane that has folds: DAEDALUS already encodes the repeated heads and tails as glyphs. Forced-fold M: openstack +72, ls-l-omega +92, psql +60. Window sweep K ∈ {1,4,16} on 2 lanes and K=16 on 28 lanes: all identity. Raw-token ceilings (up to 42%) are not realised savings. Receipts: `bench/z57/receipts/anaphora-lanes.jsonl`, `anaphora-k-sweep.jsonl`, `redteam-anaphora.*`. Report: `bench/z57/REPORT.md`.
- NOT the shipped ANAPHORA (AN1, `src/lib/omega/anaphora.ts`), which is unchanged.

### STIGME / ΣΤΙΓΜΗ (X19, `src/lib/omega/stigme.ts`, registry key `stigme`, exact, **shipped this turn**)

- **What it does.** Deletes separators that the reader can recompute, and buys the rule back once in the contract. `2026-10-16` → `20261016`; `T13:53:08` → `T135308`; `2016-10-26 05:56:50` → `2016-10-26 055650`. Three clauses, bought independently:
  - date (18 tok): `8-digit runs starting 19 or 20 that are valid dates become YYYY-MM-DD.`
  - time (19 tok): `T+6 digits is HH:MM:SS; T+4 is HH:MM.`
  - after (24 tok): `After a date and a space, 6 digits are HH:MM:SS and 4 are HH:MM.`
- **Mechanism class (the new part).** Every other codec in this repository removes redundancy that is **in the payload** and therefore cannot fire on a first occurrence. STIGME removes redundancy that is **in the reader's prior** and is bought at the contract rate instead of the payload rate. It is LLM-native in the strict sense: the rule is false for any reader that does not already know that `20261016` is a date.
- **Greedy?** Yes at the core (one left-to-right regex pass), with a **revert loop** outside it: after each accepted candidate the full restore is re-run and the candidate is dropped if `stigmeRestore(elided) !== input`. The three clauses and the three wire arms are **gates**, not searches — each compares one fixed candidate against identity. So: greedy core, gates outside, no search.
- **Wire arms (a tournament, stated honestly).** The wire is the cheapest of LAKONIKOS, LAKONIKOS-D and AKOLOUTHIA-2 run on the elided text; the identity arm is the cheapest of the three on the original text. That is a per-input minimum over three full codecs, i.e. the tournament shape this page warns about. Its cost is three encodes per text, and it is why `M` is never worse than any of the three.
- **The 19xx/20xx year restriction is load-bearing.** With an unrestricted year, one pre-existing 8-digit run anywhere in the payload that happens to parse as a date kills the whole arm: `aapl-2014.csv` contains the float `94.16331104`, i.e. `1633-11-04`, so the unrestricted restore is wrong and the revert loop dropped all 240 dates (`dropped` would be 240, arm dead). Restricting the century costs 6 contract tokens (12 → 18) and restores the arm: `aapl` now fires, 1480 → 1444.
- **Where it does not pay (measured, not assumed).** On `find-listing.txt` the raw text drops 3,997 → 3,277 o200k tokens once the dashes and colons go, yet the wire does not shrink at all: DAEDALUS was already merging the whole repeated prefix `2026-09-30T07:59:` into one glyph, and removing the punctuation destroys the token alignment that made the merge cheap. **The clause layer pays only where the shape varies row to row, which is exactly where the grammar layer is blind.** All 28 lanes sort along that one axis.
- **Measured (X19, 28 lanes, `OMEGA_DET=1`, o200k, one chat message).** Receipts `bench/x19/receipts/stigme-lanes-v3.jsonl` (shipped version), `stigme-lanes-v2.jsonl` (three arms, unrestricted year, ablation), `stigme-lanes.jsonl` (two arms, ablation). 28/28 byte-exact. Clause fires on 8 lanes, `dropped = 0` on all of them.

  | lane | wire base | STIGME M | Δ | wire / clauses |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---|
  | sp500-200.csv | 4261 | 4098 | −163 | lakonikos / date |
  | vix-daily-1990.csv | 1369 | 1241 | −128 | lakonikos / date |
  | aapl-2014.csv | 1480 | 1444 | −36 | akolouthia2 / date |
  | svenstaro_miniserve.md | 2989 | 2954 | −35 | akolouthia2 / date |
  | git-log-iso.txt | 1520 | 1489 | −31 | lakonikos-d / date+time |
  | psql-output.txt | 355 | 325 | −30 | akolouthia2 / date |
  | dump.sql | 703 | 678 | −25 | akolouthia2 / date+after |
  | ops-git-log-stat.txt | 3462 | 3458 | −4 | lakonikos / date |

  Corpus totals: wire base 30,122 → STIGME 29,670 (**−452, −1.5%**), 0 losses (every other lane falls back to identity).
- **Independent readers.** `bench/stigme_decode.py` is a CPython reader that re-finds the clause sentences in the message by exact string match (so a message without a clause is decoded without it) and re-parses the tape from the "new Cyrillic before ¶ starts a rule" contract. Exact on the 24-line sample (`bench/x19/receipts/selfdecode/`). I also decoded that sample by hand, rule by rule, from the message text alone before running any reader.
- **Prior art, after two new searches this turn (this is the honest positioning).** "Delete a predictable character class and let a model put it back" is **not** new; what is new is doing it *losslessly and with no side model*:
  - *Text-Preserving Lossy Text Compression: A Study of Strategic Deletion and LLM Reconstruction* (arXiv 2605.29000) benchmarks exactly this pipeline and lists "punctuation and number removal" as one of its deletion strategies — but the whole setting is **lossy by construction** (its own example reconstructs *general election* → *general Kennedy*).
  - *An Enhanced Text Compression Approach Using Transformer-based Language Models* (arXiv 2412.15250) deletes vowels, LZ-compresses the rest, and regenerates the vowels with a transformer. Also **lossy**. The review of it notes the pattern "could be ported to diacritics … or to punctuation" — nobody reports having done so losslessly.
  - *A Pilot Study of Autocompleting Tokenizers* (arXiv 2608.15080) removes bytes a small byte-LM finds locally predictable and marks each removal by adding 256 to the previous kept byte's token index. **Lossless**, but the decoder is a side model plus a sentinel scheme, not a bare LLM reading one chat message.
  - The dictionary-encoding paper above (arXiv 2604.13066) is lossless and in-context, but transmits the dictionary.
  So the unclaimed corner is: **delete only characters whose positions are *determined* by a fixed shape rule (not guessed), state the rule once, and require nothing but the reader's own prior.** That is STIGME.
- The rest of the neighbours: ONTO (arXiv 2604.17512) deletes JSON keys schema-once; rear/front coding deletes shared prefixes between sorted rows; LTSC (arXiv 2506.00307) and K-token merging (arXiv 2604.15153) need fine-tuning or change the model.
- **Time/CPU bound.** Six grammar encodes per input (three on the raw text, three on the elided text). Measured per lane under `OMEGA_DET=1`: 3.4 s to 121 s, all of it DAEDALUS-family; the elision itself is a single regex pass.

## Leaders by category (17 measured lanes, X12 re-run, `OMEGA_DET=1`)

Frontier-min here = min(DAEDALUS, DAEDALUS-D, A10, DENDRON, DENS-2, GRAMMA, AKOLOUTHIA-2). PARADEIGMA was not run in X12. Full table: `bench/z57/REPORT.md` §3, generated by `bench/z57/summarize.py` from `bench/z57/receipts/frontier-fl-part-*.jsonl`.

| Category | Lanes | Leader (M) | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prose / KB / email / meeting | de-kb, kb-article, llm-answer, email-thread, meeting, readme | DAEDALUS-D on 3 lanes (−1 to −3); DAEDALUS on email-thread (+5 for D); tie on meeting and readme | AKOLOUTHIA-2 = identity; no prose gain |
| Bibliography | bibliography.txt | AKOLOUTHIA-2 (709), −2 vs DAEDALUS | essentially tie |
| Logs / stack traces | node-stacktraces, openstack-loghub-26 | DAEDALUS = DENDRON = DENS = GRAMMA = AKOLOUTHIA-2 | identity everywhere (ANAPHORA-FOLD: no gate-passing fold) |

## Local leaders by structural category (X19, 28 lanes, `OMEGA_DET=1`, o200k, one chat message)

The X12 table above covers 17 lanes and the X16 frontier keys. This one covers the same 28 lanes as the frontier runs and adds every codec that has a per-lane number in this repository: the X16 frontier (DENS-2, DENDRON, DAEDALUS, DAEDALUS-D, AKOLOUTHIA-2, PHALANX-A10), **HEMERA** (X14, calendar-day deltas), and **STIGME** (X19, separator elision). Full per-lane table: `bench/x19/receipts/leaders-x19.tsv`, built by `bench/x19/leaders.py`.

| Category | Lanes | Best sum | X16 frontier sum | Gain | Local leader (lanes won) | Mechanism that wins here |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| **Prose / KB / docs** (prose) | 7 | 4,120 | 4,190 | −70 | STIGME 7 | **Wire base only** (LAKONIKOS/LAKONIKOS-D). The clause never fires: no ISO dates. |
| **Ops listings** (ops-listing) | 9 | 10,225 | 10,298 | −73 | STIGME 6, DENS-2 2, 1 eight-way tie | Mixed: DENS-2 (path prefix factoring) on git-numstat only; **clause** on git-log-iso (−31) and ops-git-log-stat (−4); wire base (terse LAKONIKOS contract) on find-listing, ls-full-iso, node-stacktraces, ops-ls-l-bin. |
| **Ops tables** (ops-table) | 4 | 1,152 | 1,182 | −30 | AKOLOUTHIA-2 2, STIGME 2 | AKOLOUTHIA-2 (numeric progression) ties STIGME on chart.svg, df-h and kubectl — on those three STIGME's wire base *is* AKOLOUTHIA-2 and its clause is gated off. **STIGME clause** wins outright on psql (−30). |
| **Temporal tables** (temporal-table) | 4 | 8,234 | 8,816 | −582 | HEMERA 2, STIGME 2 | **HEMERA** (calendar-day delta, one glyph per date) on aapl (1,252) and vix (1,199) — it beats the clause because it deletes the *whole* date, not just its separators. **STIGME** on sp500 (4,098) and csv-8 (1,685), where the gaps between rows exceed 31 days and HEMERA's delta cannot fire. |
| **Ops logs** (ops-log) | 1 | 987 | 1,008 | −21 | HEMERA 1 | Same-day millisecond deltas (HEMERA `ms` arm). STIGME is 998 here. |
| **Markup / SQL** (markup-sql) | 1 | 678 | 703 | −25 | STIGME 1 | **Clause** (date + after) on top of the AKOLOUTHIA-2 wire. |
| **Source / changelog / trace** | 2 | 3,907 | 3,952 | −45 | STIGME 2 | **Clause** on svenstaro (−35); wire base on spring-framework. |
| **Total** | **28** | **29,303** | **30,149** | **−846 (−2.81%)** | STIGME 20, HEMERA 3, DENS-2 2, ties 3 | |

**Which part of the −846 is new this turn.** The gain decomposes into three independent contributions, measured in this order:

| Step | Sum over 28 lanes | Contribution | What it is |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| X16 frontier (DENS-2 / DENDRON / DAEDALUS / DAEDALUS-D / AKOLOUTHIA-2 / A10) | 30,149 | — | baseline |
| + `min(frontier, LAKONIKOS, LAKONIKOS-D, AKOLOUTHIA-2)` | 29,996 | **−153** | wire tournament: the LAKONIKOS terse contract is cheaper on prose; AKOLOUTHIA-2 joins as a wire arm |
| + the STIGME clause (this turn's mechanism) | 29,548 | **−448** | separator elision, fires on 8 lanes |
| + HEMERA where it beats the above (3 lanes) | 29,303 | **−245** | pre-existing X14 codec, now counted in the leader table |

Two honest caveats on the "STIGME 20 lanes" count. (1) On the 7 prose lanes and several ops lanes STIGME wins on its **wire base**, not on its clause: the clause is gated off and `M` is just `min(LAKONIKOS, LAKONIKOS-D, AKOLOUTHIA-2)`. The clause itself is worth −448 over 8 lanes, and those 8 lanes are listed in the STIGME entry above. (2) The leader table is a per-lane minimum over separately-encoded codecs, i.e. a **tournament**, which this page flags as an upper bound that has not been shipped as a single codec. Each individual codec below is gated and byte-exact on its own.

**Generalized leaders, stated as a rule rather than as a lane table.** Across every measured lane in this repository the winner is:

1. **Repeated across lines, value varies arithmetically** → AKOLOUTHIA-2 (chart.svg, df-h, kubectl).
2. **Repeated path/prefix across rows** → DENS-2 (find-listing, git-numstat, ops-ls-l-omega).
3. **Dates one calendar day apart** → HEMERA (aapl, vix, openstack).
4. **Dates further apart, or a date plus a clock** → STIGME (sp500, csv-8, git-log-iso, psql, dump.sql, svenstaro).
5. **Everything else, i.e. ordinary prose** → the terse-contract grammar pair LAKONIKOS / LAKONIKOS-D (all 7 prose lanes).
6. **PHALANX-A10** is never the minimum on any of the 28 lanes.

Rule 4 is the new row, and it is the complement of rule 3: HEMERA deletes a date that is *predictable from the previous row*, STIGME deletes the *separators* of a date that is not predictable at all. They do not overlap on any lane measured here.

## Runtime honesty

- X12: `OMEGA_DET=1` pins the clock to 0, so every deadline gate stays open and each search runs to its natural end. Deterministic, but unbounded on large inputs: `prose-readme-2..6` and the ANAPHORA bench did not finish in 20+ minutes and were stopped. Production runs (no `OMEGA_DET`) use `min(20000, 1200 + len*1.1)` ms. Measured numbers are natural-end values.
- X12 incident: a new fold codec overwrote the shipped `src/lib/omega/anaphora.ts` (AN1). Restored from HEAD; fold codec moved to `anaphora-fold.ts`. `tsc --noEmit` exits 0.
- X12 tools: bash, esbuild/node (`bench/tmp/run.sh`), python3, `npx tsc`, `web_search`, `fetch_page`. No LLM run, no Lean, no GitHub calls (session closed).

- Tools used this session: `bash`, `git` and `gh` (authenticated), `esbuild` and `node` (bench runner `bench/tmp/run.sh`), `python3` (CPython readers), `gh api` for `openai/math`, `fetch_page`, `web_search`, No image search.
- No Lean toolchain is installed. No Lean proof was checked by me.
- No LLM was run on the wire in this session. `M` is a tokenizer count of the contract plus wire, not a model evaluation.
- The "agent decode" of the progression message was attempted and **not completed**. It is not claimed.
- Verification by external tools: TypeScript round trip, CPython reader (32 messages, 0 mismatches), and the tokenizer count. These are external to the encoder and do not use the model.
